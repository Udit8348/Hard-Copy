## Motivation
At first thought, printing code may seem unneccesary when you can readily view it on nearly all of todays devices. I couldn't give you a better answer than when I was struggling to learn the PID feedbback loop. No matter who explained it to me, it made no sense. It was only until I printed a PID library and annotated it by hand, that it clicked in my head. More frequently, I find myself rushing to print my team's latest complete source code for our notebook. I have tried at many word processing tools and add-ons before, but nothing offers a fully customizable way to print code while maintaining formatting and organization. I was really interested in taking on this project when I saw a BLRS' TP code release. Out of the box, I had some issues getting it to work, but eventually with some modifications, I got it working. I was also interseted in the controller mapping project done by * Understanding how it worked made me think about how I could implement my own make file recipie in a pros project. It reminded me of the latex project I had been working on early, so I decided to merge both ideas and came up with this. I am aware that there are tools like doxygen that can format your code like professional documetnation, yet the issue still becomes converting it to a printer format. Notepad++ is one of the few common text editors that actually let you print your code, however I am not aware of a straighforward way to group format and print an entire project. In an attempt to create a VRC/VEXU competitor friendly tool, I elected to take inspiration from the aforementioned projects and create Hard-Copy.
